# Why are there no repositories here?

Good question. The short answer is there was an unbelieveable amount of garbage here and I trashed it. Most of them were left over from my first year of freelancing when the only jobs I could get were hacking on Wordpress plugins. (I know. I'm not ashamed, either. I'll own it. Even bad coding is better than punching a clock at a plant or driving a service truck. I understand the conjecture and I stand by that statement.) Some of them were even empty repos from bids that never won contracts. Some of them were failed startups that never called me back. All of it was cringy. I even cringe at the few that I left.

A better answer is I've been putting a lot of thought into my career and my company lately and I decided it's time to clean things up and jump to the next level. Every once in a while, I look back on where I've been and realize that I'm stagnating. The first thing I like to do is clean house. Then I talk to a few people, read a few books, read a few blogs, play around with some new tech. Then I have to make some serious choices and start setting goals. 

## So where do we go from here?
- Terraform modules and docker compose files. Automated elastic infrastructure as code has become my specialty and regardless of what languages I use to build software, the infrastructure that it sits on will always be crucial. And cloud is not going anywhere either. Whether I stick with AWS or I branch out to Google or Azure or some other cloud provider that pops up and wants to disrupt cloud, this is a skill that will be transferrable. 
- Python. I've got my eye on machine learning and I've been playing around with IoT on Raspberry Pi devices. Python is also very handy for cloud automation. I find that over time I'm working more in Python and less in Bash when I'm on a server. Expect more Python.
- C#. Game engines like Unity are the key to AR and VR and every mixed reality in between. Most of the heavy scripting behind these programs is written in C#
- Laravel and Vue.js. Love it or hate it, PHP is going to be here for a long time and frameworks like Laravel make it so much easier to train a team of developers to build quick, secure and powerful web apps if you teach them to do it right. And Laravel is pretty much married to Vue.js. 
- React.js. I could argue Angular, Vue or React when it comes to JavaScript frameworks. I'm going with React, though. It's got strong community. It's still growing. And it's got great support for Ionic, which is overtaking the native app community in terms of popularity.

That's all for now. Expect awesome commits soon!
